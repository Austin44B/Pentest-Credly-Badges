In earning the Pentest+ [Architecture](https://www.credly.com/badges/9fbb9013-f96a-416c-a9f6-90b25936a858/public_url) badge : 

I Learned about OpenVAS which is a vulnerability scanner by Greenbone Security.

Utilized a Social Engineering Toolkit called (SET) which is an open source framework for social engineering written in python that is text based and a menu driven program, with the most commonly used areas of SET including spear phishing, website, payload and mailer attacks.

Performed post-exploitation techniques after following tools during phases of a penetration test such as setting up bind and reverse shells utilizing netcat (nc). In a bind shell, set up a simple chat server where two VM's listened and echoed between each other. After understanding a bind shell, I used metasploitable2 for a web command injection to catch a reverse shell from a listener on an attack box to make a connection back to the target, which is considered the most common method for catching a reverse shell.

In earning the Pentest+ [Automation](https://www.credly.com/earner/earned/badge/e9f1823e-acb1-4d24-a77c-e83b519ed9b2) badge : 

I Learned about basic concepts of programming shells such as BASH ( Bourne Again Shell ) and Python. BASH is very powerful shell environment that has its own integrated programming or scripting language. A script is a series of commands that can be typed at the command prompt but strung together to automate a task. Python is a programming language which can be used to make scripts or full featured programs.
Using scripting and software development I automated some pentest related tasks such as creating a simple script with BASH that takes user input, runs an nmap scan of metasploitable2 and then uses a program called xsltprox to generate a HTML format report. I also created a more complex Python script which can be used as a port scanner when nmap is not available.

In earning the Pentest+ [Infrastructure](https://www.credly.com/badges/cdd0b02f-2dc7-4037-8740-8e4135c12c06/public_url) badge, I learned, utilized and explained the results of a handful of tools throughout a penetration testing.

Starting with an internet reconnaissance, I used some common tools such as Nslookup, Dig and Whois, Using these tools I performed passive and active reconnaissance and analyzed the results gathered. Nslookup is a program to query the internet Domain Name System (DNS) by operating in one of two modes : Interactive or Non-Interactive. Domain Information Groper (DIG) is commonly used for DNS troubleshooting and domain reconnaissance and Whois is a useful tool to start with as it provides information on domain names, IP address blocks and autonomous systems.

Another set of reconnaissance tools for Penetration testing that I learned about, are popular OSINT ( Open Source Intelligence ) Tools such as, Maltego, ReconNG, theHarvester, Google Dorks and the Shodan website. Maltego is an information gathering and data analysis tool that can help visualize how information on a target is connected. Recon-ng is a recon framework for gathering information from web based sources. theHarvester, is a tool used to gather information on email, domains, subdomains, open ports, banners and more from sources such as the Shodan search engine. And Google Dorks is utilizing the Advanced search features of Google for reconnaissance.

Moving into a more active reconnaissance, I used various enumeration techniques from gathered system information to identify potential attack vectors by "Finding the lowest hanging fruit", in other words, finding entry points from analyzing scan details line by line from utilized tools such as Dirb and Nikto. Dirb is a web content scanner and Nikto is a web server vulnerability scanning tool.

The CompTia PenTest+ Infrastructure badge covers exam objectives in sections, 2.1, 2.2, 2.3, 3.7 and 5.3.

In earning the Pentest+ [Operations](https://www.credly.com/badges/d5929fb9-577f-4566-b6d7-4f64de34f11b/public_url) badge : 

I learned about one of the most widely used network scanning tools, Nmap ! Nmap ( Network Mapper ) is an open source network scanner and security auditing tool. Nmap uses raw network packets to determine what hosts are on a network and the operating system and services running on each host. Nmap supports several scan types such as ARP, UDP and by default a full TCP handshake. Additionally Nmap has tons of features that include options to avoid detection by firewalls, IDS systems and one of the most common features is an option ( -A ) which performs OS detection, version detection of services, script scanning for vulnerabilities and traceroute, all in one !

After learning about Nmap, I Ethically used it to perform a vulnerability scan on a target for reconnaissance by sending crafted TCP and UDP packets for gathering information, I then analyzed the output of scan results for detailed information on the target.

Another fun tool for research and ethical hacking is aircrack-ng ! I used aircrack-ng suite tools to explore a WPA & WPA2 wireless network, and ethically crack wifi passwords that were captured with airodump-ng. The Aircrack-ng suite of tools is built for assessing the network security of wireless networks. It has tools for monitoring, attacking, testing, and cracking wifi communications !

The CompTia PenTest+ Operations badge covers exam objectives in sections, 2.3, 2.4, 3.1 and 3.2

In earning the Pentest+ [Security](https://www.credly.com/badges/f7f265ff-74f7-4b5c-b46a-7e6b13248278/public_url) badge : 

I learned how to navigate steganography tools which hide and conceal messages within another file such as a text file or photo. Stegahide is one such steganography application that can help with computer forensic investigations. Using Stegahide we can hide bits of data in the least significant bits on top of another file, this make the data file only accessible using a tool to extract the data in combination with the password we create.

Following up Stegahide I then dove into learning about discovering IoT devices with Shodan.io search engine, which is used to gather critical information on IoT devices connected to the internet in real time. Using Shodan.io search engine to search for IoT devices connected to the internet, is a veritable playground for hackers as devices are not always properly secured and can be riddled with vulnerabilities and default password credentials. Properly securing your IoT devices is paramount to avoid a hacker from exploiting your IoT devices, especially in the age of automation, where hackers are running scripts that look for and attack everything possible regardless of anything.

And wrapping up the Security badge was with a fun one that I used extensively during my real world lab scenario pentesting machines, which was how John the ripper and Hydra which are password attack tools, can be used either locally or remotely to exploit weak or vulnerable passwords for machines and networks. John the ripper can be used as a offline password cracker by downloading the passwd and shadow files from a compromised linux system or databases, then combining these files with the unshadow command and passing this file to John the ripper for attempting to crack. Whereas Hydra is used to conduct an online brute force attack, which is also far noiser, though has a range of options and can attack a large number of services including the main services such as SMTP, Telnet, SSH and FTP.

In earning the Pentest+ [Troubleshooting](https://www.credly.com/badges/a3b9ead4-f959-4130-b7a2-302b66a02a1d/public_url) badge :

I learned about various web scanners used during a penetration testing such as Skipfish, wpscan, whatweb, sqlmap, Nikto and Dirb. Particularly, Nikto is an open source web scanner that is a very comprehensive tool which test web servers for 1000's of dangerous programs, files, vulnerabilities, and server configuration issues. Additionally Dirb is a web content scanner that scans and crawls web servers looking for web objects, even hidden ones. It basically does this by conducting a dictionary based attack on the web server. also A user can create their own dictionaries for custom attacks. These dictionary based attacks are a great way to see if there are hidden web pages that admins use for other tasks, not typically seen by the common user.

After scanning and potentially finding an exploit, I learned how a hacker could use Metasploit which is a powerful penetration testing platform framework, metasploit comes in both a commercial pro and a open source community version, in which the community version is included with kali linux. Metasploit comes with hundreds of exploits, payloads and additional resources to assist during a penetration test. Metasploit also leverages the power of Nmap ! Additionally metasploit comes with a scanner for SSH, Telnet, SMB and SMTP. Metasploit shows the importance of keeping systems up to date with most current versions as it only takes one vulnerable machine, for a hacker to exploit and gain access to potentially a whole network, and a tool such as metasploit makes such a task that much easier.
